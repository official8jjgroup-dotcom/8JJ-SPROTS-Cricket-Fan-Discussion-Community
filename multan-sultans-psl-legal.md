# Multan Sultans Owner Threatens Legal Action Over PSL Renewal

**Multan Sultans owner Ali Khan Tareen** has threatened legal action against the **Pakistan Super League (PSL)** following delays in the renewal of his franchise contract. Tareen expressed frustration at the league's management for failing to communicate about valuations and renewal letters, while other PSL franchises reportedly received their updates.

## Tareen Raises Concerns Over PSL Management

Tareen publicly criticized the PSL and **Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB)** management for unprofessional handling of the franchise renewal process. In a social media post on **November 19**, he stated:  
*"If this ghosting continues we will have no choice but to take legal action… fragile egos make simple things difficult."*

The controversy follows a prior incident where Tareen publicly rejected a PCB notice requesting a public apology, highlighting ongoing tensions with the league authorities.

### Franchise Renewal Dispute

The conflict stems from the PCB’s apparent refusal to renew **Multan Sultans’ franchise contract**, while agreements for other teams have reportedly been finalized. Multiple emails and legal letters regarding valuation and renewal have gone unanswered by PSL management.  

Other franchise representatives have questioned why Multan Sultans are being excluded from the renewal process, further fueling the dispute.

#### Contractual Implications

Experts indicate the existing Multan Sultans franchise agreement runs until **December 31, 2025**, obliging PSL to provide all relevant information, including valuations from **Ernst & Young (EY)** and updated agreement letters.  

Failure to provide this information could constitute a breach of the franchise agreement. Notably, the EY valuation was funded through PSL resources, with contributions from Multan Sultans. The franchise remains compliant under league rules.

### PCB Response and Future of PSL

The PCB confirmed that renewal offers for compliant franchises have been issued after completing the independent valuation process. The board also indicated they are considering terminating Multan Sultans’ contract due to alleged breaches of the PSL code of conduct.  

The PSL currently includes teams from **Peshawar, Islamabad, Lahore, Quetta, Karachi, and Multan**. Expansion plans to eight teams may include cities such as **Hyderabad, Sialkot, Faisalabad, and Rawalpindi**.

## Legal Battle and Implications for PSL

The dispute between Ali Khan Tareen and PSL management raises questions about franchise governance and transparency. Legal action could impact the league’s renewal timeline and expansion plans. Observers note that resolving conflicts swiftly is essential to maintain credibility and investor confidence in Pakistan’s premier cricket league.  

With the franchise contract still active and Multan Sultans compliant, resolution will hinge on effective communication between PSL management and the franchise owner, potentially shaping the future model for PSL renewals.
