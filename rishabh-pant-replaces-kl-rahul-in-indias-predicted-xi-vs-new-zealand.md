[Rishabh Pant has replaced KL Rahul in India’s predicted XI for the first ODI against New Zealand](https://8jjsports.com/rishabh-pant-replaces-kl-rahul-in-india-predicted/), as veteran Irfan Pathan shared his playing XI ahead of the three-match series starting January 11 in Vadodara. The inclusion of Pant signals a tactical shift, with the dynamic wicketkeeper-batter expected to provide stability in the middle order.

India will be keen to bounce back after recent setbacks, and the team management appears focused on fielding a balanced side capable of adapting to local conditions. With Pant’s aggressive intent and experience, India will look to set a dominant tone early in the series against a competitive New Zealand side.
