While nations such as **Haiti** and **Curaçao** made strides on the global stage, India continued its cycle of underwhelming performances, raising concerns about long-term competitiveness.

### On-Field Performance Concerns

## Administrative Chaos in AIFF

The **All India Football Federation (AIFF)** remains embroiled in controversy and inefficiency, struggling to secure investment and manage domestic competitions.

A senior executive openly criticized the federation’s *“laziness”*, pointing to internal politics, bureaucratic hurdles, and a lack of professional leadership—hindrances that continue to stall progress across all levels of the sport.

### ISL Revenue Disputes

For the last 15 years, AIFF has received **₹50 crore annually** from the **Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL)**, a Reliance subsidiary. With the contract expiring on **December 8, 2025**, negotiations for renewal have sparked conflict.

AIFF’s new demands include:

- **₹37.5 crore** annually, or  
- **5% of annual revenue**  

The federation’s valuation of other football properties, including the national teams, at just **₹12.5 crore**, has raised eyebrows across the Indian football ecosystem.

This stagnation threatens both elite and grassroots football, making it harder for India to produce competitive players.

- Investor reluctance due to governance failures  
- Stunted youth development pathways  
- Reduced fan engagement and media coverage
