## Late Squad Changes for Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) confirmed that Asalanka and Fernando will return home for treatment, missing the three-nation T20I tri-series.  
Team management and medical staff advised their precautionary withdrawal to ensure proper recovery ahead of future commitments.

In Asalanka’s absence, former white-ball captain **Dasun Shanaka** has been entrusted with leadership responsibilities.

### Replacements and Squad Updates

SLC selectors have included **Pavan Rathnayake** and **Vijayakanth Viyaskanth** as replacements.  
Viyaskanth joins the squad from Qatar, where he represented Sri Lanka A in the Asia Cup Rising Stars tournament, stepping in while **Wanindu Hasaranga** recovers from hamstring tightness.

These late changes ensure that Sri Lanka remains competitive despite key players being sidelined due to injury and illness.

#### Tri-Series Fixtures and Schedule Adjustments

Sri Lanka will open their tri-series campaign against **Zimbabwe on November 20** in Rawalpindi.

Following a suicide bombing in Islamabad, several players raised safety concerns.  
SLC engaged with PCB and local authorities to confirm adequate security measures, allowing the team to continue the tour.

The ODI series preceding the tri-series also saw changes, with matches moved to **November 14 and 16** from their original dates.  
The tri-series itself was pushed from **November 17 to November 18**.

### Leadership and Team Outlook

With Dasun Shanaka taking charge, Sri Lanka aims to maintain stability and performance despite the absence of its original captain.  
Shanaka’s white-ball experience is expected to guide the squad, including newcomers Rathnayake and Viyaskanth.

Sri Lanka’s management remains focused on balancing recovery periods with international commitments to ensure peak performance.

## Looking Ahead

The T20I tri-series in Pakistan offers a competitive platform for Sri Lanka to test its bench strength and build momentum ahead of future fixtures.
