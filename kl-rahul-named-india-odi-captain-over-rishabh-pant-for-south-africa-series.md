KL Rahul has been appointed India's captain for the upcoming three-match ODI series against South Africa, taking the reins in the absence of regular skipper Shubman Gill, who is sidelined with a neck injury sustained during the first Test against the Proteas in Kolkata. Rahul's leadership is intended as a short-term arrangement focused on this series.

## 🎯 Why KL Rahul Was Chosen Over Rishabh Pant

Rishabh Pant was overlooked for the captaincy primarily due to his limited recent ODI experience, having played only one game in the past year. A BCCI source revealed that selectors are treating Rahul's appointment as a temporary measure, with Gill expected to return for the series against New Zealand in January 2026.

### Strategic Decision for Series Against South Africa

Rahul's captaincy is seen as tactical, designed to provide stability and leadership while navigating an injury-hit squad. With Pant lacking consistent ODI exposure, Rahul's experience made him the preferred choice to lead India against a formidable South African side.

With Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj rested for workload management, this series allows India to balance key players' fitness and match readiness.

### Leadership Focus for KL Rahul

KL Rahul's captaincy aims to guide a partially rotated squad while keeping team strategy coherent. Balancing experience with youth will be crucial in managing South Africa's challenge, especially given the absence of regular leaders and the need to maintain momentum in the ODI setup.
