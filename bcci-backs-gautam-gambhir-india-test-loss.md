## India vs South Africa Test Ends in Controversy

The first Test ended with India being bowled out for 93 while chasing 124, sparking social media criticism targeting Gambhir. BCCI secretary **Devajit Saikia** reaffirmed support, emphasizing confidence in Gambhir and the team despite a single loss.

### BCCI’s Statement on Coaching Decisions

Speaking to RevSportz, Saikia said:  
*"The BCCI has full confidence in our selectors, our coaching team, including the head coach and the players. We do not distinguish anybody. We give full support and that is why they are doing well."*  
He noted that social media criticism is inevitable but does not reflect the team’s overall performance.

#### Context Behind the Criticism

Much of the backlash focused on Gambhir’s request for a spin-friendly pitch and batting order changes, notably sending **Washington Sundar** to bat at No. 3. Expectations were high, given India’s strong bowling attack.

## Support from India’s Batting Coach Sitanshu Kotak

Batting coach **Sitanshu Kotak** strongly defended Gambhir, noting that much criticism comes from individuals with personal agendas.  
*"Gautam took the blame on himself because he didn’t want the curators to take the blame. Definitely, when we play in India—just like other countries play to their strengths—we rely on spin. Fast bowlers remain in the game on Day 1 and Day 2,"* Kotak explained.

### Criticism Overshadows Team Performance

Kotak highlighted that media often focuses only on Gambhir during defeats, ignoring players’ contributions or other coaching staff efforts.

#### Past Performances Offer Context

The first Test loss marked India’s fourth home Test defeat under Gambhir. Kotak pointed to successes such as the Champions Trophy, Asia Cup, and the England series as evidence of effective leadership.

## Strategic Decisions Under the Microscope

Gambhir’s request for a spin-friendly pitch did not yield the desired advantage, raising debates over tactical choices. Sending Washington Sundar to No. 3 contributed to discussions on risk and reward in team selection.

### Balancing Risk and Reward in Team Selection

Gambhir’s strategy balances youth and experience, experimenting with batting orders and tactical plans to strengthen the team for future series.

#### Focus on Long-Term Growth

Both Saikia and Kotak emphasized that Gambhir’s strategies are designed for long-term growth, and the BCCI’s backing ensures continuity for players.

## Public Reaction and Media Scrutiny

The Kolkata Test ignited social media debate over perceived errors. Supporters of Gambhir stress considering broader factors such as pitch conditions, opposition performance, and overall team form.

### Lessons for Future Test Matches

Gambhir and coaching staff are likely to review tactical decisions, including pitch preparation and batting order, to improve future performance.

#### Conclusion: BCCI Stands Firm Behind Gautam Gambhir

Despite criticism, the **BCCI has full confidence** in Gambhir. The coaching staff aims to learn from the loss while reinforcing team stability. India’s successes in major tournaments demonstrate that Gambhir’s strategies, though occasionally questioned, are part of a broader plan for sustained growth in international cricket.
