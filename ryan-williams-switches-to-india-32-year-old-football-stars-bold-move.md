## ⚽ Football Roots and Early Life

Williams has deep ties to India. His mother hails from an Anglo-Indian family in Mumbai, while his father is from Kent, England. Football runs in his blood: his maternal grandfather, Lincoln "Linky" Grostate, played in the Santosh Trophy for Bombay during the 1950s, cementing a family legacy in the sport.

Raised in Australia, Williams later moved to England, joining Portsmouth's academy in 2010. He made his professional debut for Portsmouth against Middlesbrough and played for several English clubs including Fulham, Gillingham, Oxford United, Barnsley, Rotherham United, and Perth Glory, gaining valuable international experience before moving to India.

Known for his pace, dribbling, and attacking versatility, he brought professionalism and tactical intelligence to the squad. His international exposure added a new dimension to Bengaluru FC, inspiring younger players and strengthening the team's competitive edge.

## 🛂 Journey to Indian National Team Eligibility

Williams' ambition to represent India began when Sunil Chhetri first notified the All India Football Federation (AIFF). Given India's restriction on dual citizenship, Williams had to renounce his Australian nationality to qualify. A 2008 Sports Ministry policy under MS Gill requires all players representing India to hold an Indian passport, making OCI and PIO athletes ineligible without a full citizenship change.

## ✅ FIFA Approval and Official Clearance

On November 20, 2025, FIFA's Players' Status Chamber (PSC) approved Williams' switch to the Indian national team. According to AIFF, "FIFA reviewed the request under RGAS standards and confirmed all eligibility criteria were met. Ryan Williams is now officially eligible for India." This clearance allows India to utilize Williams' experience in international matches and qualifiers.
