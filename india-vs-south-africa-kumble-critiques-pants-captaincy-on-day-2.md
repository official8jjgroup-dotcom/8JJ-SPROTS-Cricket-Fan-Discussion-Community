## 💬 Anil Kumble Criticizes India's Lack of Early Aggression

Kumble highlighted that India's slow start in the morning session allowed South Africa's batters to settle. According to him, the team should have taken bold decisions early:

### Need for Attacking Field Placements

Kumble emphasized the importance of aggressive field settings. "I thought they could have been a little more aggressive at the start — a bit more attacking. We finally saw some of that in the last over before tea, when they brought in a short leg, a silly point, and packed the fielders around," he said. Kumble pointed out that on flat pitches where the ball does not naturally turn, India must force batters into mistakes through proactive tactics.

#### Encouraging Wicket-Taking Chances

He added, "On a pitch where nothing much is happening, you have to make things happen. You need to force the batter into a shot — that's how you create wicket-taking chances." Kumble stressed that using the depth of the crease, combining spin with aggressive fielding, and varying options are key to generating breakthroughs against resilient opponents.

## 👏 Praise for South African Batting

While critiquing India, Kumble also acknowledged South Africa's excellence. He noted, "Credit to the South African batters, though. Both Muthusamy and Kyle Verreynne have batted exceptionally well. They've used their feet nicely — and by that I don't just mean stepping out; using the depth of the crease as well." Their composure on a flat pitch made India's task significantly harder.

## 🎯 India's Adaptation to Spin-Friendly Pitches

Kumble observed that Indian teams are often accustomed to spin-friendly tracks where wickets come naturally. "If you're going to have long-off, long-on, and deep cover from the start, it becomes comfortable for the batter. India may simply be unused to situations where wickets aren't falling regularly; they're accustomed to pitches where spinners naturally dominate," he explained. On such wickets, proactive field placements and inventive tactics become essential.

## 🔮 Strategic Takeaways for India on Day 3

Kumble's assessment indicates that India must rethink their approach for Day 3. Bold declarations, attacking fields, and forcing errors from batters are crucial to claw back into the India vs South Africa 2nd Test. The focus will be on putting pressure early, ensuring partnerships are challenged, and maximizing opportunities against a dominant South African lineup.

### Importance of Aggression in Test Cricket

The Guwahati Test highlights the significance of tactical aggression. By challenging batters early, India can create chances even on placid surfaces. Kumble's advice underscores that combining patience with proactive strategy is vital for India to reverse their fortunes in this crucial series.
