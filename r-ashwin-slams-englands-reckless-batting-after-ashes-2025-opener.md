R Ashwin delivered a scathing critique of England's performance in the first Ashes 2025 Test against Australia in Perth, describing their batting approach as "reckless." England's much-hyped Bazball strategy failed to deliver as the team collapsed twice for under 200 runs, with no batter lasting more than 61 deliveries. Australia capitalized on the poor batting, registering an eight-wicket victory inside two days.

## 🏏 England's Disastrous Ashes Opener

England's batting lineup faltered dramatically on Day 1 and Day 2 of the Ashes 2025 opener. Their first innings ended at 172, losing five wickets in quick succession. Ashwin highlighted that this reckless approach failed to protect the bowlers, who were forced to return quickly to defend a paltry total of 200. The collapse left Australia with a comfortable eight-wicket win, emphasizing the gulf between the two sides.

### Ashwin Critiques Bazball Strategy

Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ashwin questioned the effectiveness of England's Bazball style. "But how reckless will reckless suffice? I am actually thinking, where will the bandwidth of the word 'reckless' remain?" he asked, criticizing England for not showing restraint and failing to protect the team's position. According to Ashwin, even younger teams must balance aggression with responsibility, especially in Test cricket.

## 💥 England Failed to Support Their Bowlers

Ashwin stressed the importance of batting to allow bowlers rest and recovery. "Your first job as a batting unit is to give your bowlers overnight rest and see how your bowlers respond," he said. England's inability to do so left their bowlers under pressure, further compounding the team's troubles. The result highlighted a lack of tactical awareness and discipline in crucial moments.

### England's Batters Under Scrutiny

No England batter lasted more than 61 balls, showing a worrying pattern of rash shot-making. Ashwin remarked on the absence of patience and the excessive reliance on lofted shots, which resulted in quick wickets. The former Indian spinner suggested that this kind of recklessness, if continued, could make the Ashes tour "very, very, very long" for England.

## 💬 Ashwin's Message to England

Ashwin acknowledged that commentators like Michael Vaughan have expressed faith in England's ability to bounce back. However, he warned that without a marked change in approach, England risks a tough and demoralizing series. His analysis stresses the importance of strategic batting, responsible shot selection, and understanding the flow of a Test match.

### Key Takeaways from Ashwin's Critique

- England's Bazball strategy backfired in the opener
- Lack of patience led to collapses under pressure
- Bowlers were deprived of adequate rest due to batting failures
- Strategic shot selection is crucial in Test cricket
- England must regroup quickly to avoid a long, difficult tour

## 🎯 Conclusion

R Ashwin's candid verdict highlights the gaps in England's batting approach and serves as a warning for the rest of the Ashes 2025 series. If they fail to adopt a more measured approach, Australia could dominate the series from the outset.
