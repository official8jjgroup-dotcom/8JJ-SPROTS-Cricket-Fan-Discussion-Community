# Bangladesh Women Tour Postponed: 3 Key Details

The **Bangladesh Women cricket tour of India** has been postponed indefinitely, leaving fans and players awaiting a new schedule. The **Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB)** confirmed on November 18 that the planned white-ball series in December will not take place as initially scheduled.

## Reason Behind Bangladesh Women Tour Postponement

The series was expected to feature **three ODIs and three T20Is** against India starting mid-December. However, the **Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)** informed the BCB that they are unable to host the series. Indian players will receive an extended break following their maiden World Cup victory.  

**BCB Women’s Wing Chairman Abdur Razzak** emphasized:  
*"Yes, they have informed us that the series is not happening as per discussion, but that does not mean it is abandoned. We can say the tour has been postponed and it will be rescheduled."*

### Impact on ICC Women's ODI Championship

The ODI matches were to mark the start of a new cycle in the **ICC Women’s ODI Championship** for both India and Bangladesh. The postponement disrupts the initial **Future Tour Program**, which is crucial for international rankings and preparation for upcoming tournaments.

#### Scheduling and Travel Plans

Bangladesh players were expected to depart for India around **December 14–15**. With the indefinite postponement, travel plans are on hold, and a new timeline is yet to be confirmed.

### Context from Other Tours

The postponement mirrors recent scheduling changes in international cricket. For example, the Indian men’s white-ball tour of Bangladesh in August 2025 was delayed and is now rescheduled for **September 2026**. This reflects ongoing adjustments to accommodate player rest and domestic leagues like the **Women’s Premier League (WPL)**.

## Looking Ahead for Bangladesh Women Cricket

The **BCB** remains committed to rescheduling the series, ensuring Bangladesh Women get the opportunity to compete against India in a full white-ball tour. Fans can expect official announcements in the coming months as both boards finalize new dates.  

The postponement is a temporary setback but ensures the integrity of the **ICC Women’s ODI Championship** and player welfare are preserved. Balancing international commitments with domestic tournaments like the **WPL** is essential to maintain competitive performance globally.
